                        <em><b>New York:</b></em> For decades, fast-food giant <i>Burger King</i> has been the undisputed Home of the Whopper -- the chain's signature sandwich featuring one of its flame-grilled, "no nonsense" 100 percent beef patties.
                        So, what happens when the Whopper doesn't actually have any meat?
                        BK is going vegan. That's right, folks: enter the Impossible Whopper, a meatless version of "America's favorite burger."
                        Made up of mostly soy and potato protein, and featuring coconut oil, sunflower oil and heme -- an iron-rich protein that simulates the texture, color and taste of actual meat.
                        For years, Burger King has offered a veggie burger on the menu at its thousands of restaurants, but it was not marketed as anything even remotely resembling a juicy, tender slab of meat.
                        So far, the Impossible Whopper is only available at several dozen restaurants in the Midwestern city of St Louis.
                        But Burger King's chief marketing officer Fernando Machado told The New York Times that the company expects to quickly expand availability nationwide if all goes well.
                        "I have high expectations that it's going to be big business, not just a niche product," Machado told the paper.

                    <em>New Delhi</em>: India on Tuesday sent a diplomatic note to <em>Pakistan</em>, urging it to make necessary arrangements for an immediate release and repatriation of 10 Indian prisoners who had completed the prison sentence in Pakistani jails.
                    India has also made a fresh demand seeking consular access to five Indian nationals, including Kulbhushan Jadhav, whose case is pending at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
                    The Ministry of External Affairs sent the note verbale to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi in which India has conveyed its "deep concern" over the long pending release and repatriation of Indian prisoners held under Pakistan custody despite completion of sentence and nationality confirmation, MEA sources told news agency ANI.
                    Kulbhushan Jadhav's name figured in the category of Indian 'civilian' prisoners in Pakistan's custody with long-pending requests for consular access. Kulbhushan Jadhav's name figures with four others - Mohammad Javaid, Abdul Hameed, Muhammad Ismail, Salfikar Ali.
                    Kulbhushan Jadhav, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of alleged "espionage" in 2016. Pakistan claims he was arrested from Balochistan, while India maintains that he was kidnapped from Iran.
                    In the note verbale India said, "... consular access to Indian fishermen and prisoners in Pakistan jails is inordinately delayed. Such delays cause an avoidable delay in confirmation of their nationality and thus detrimental to the timely release of prisoners and fishermen."

                        Royal Challengers Bangalore have had a nightmarish campaign so far. They lost the IPL 2019 opener to Chennai Super Kings and went down to Mumbai Indians in their first home match in Bengaluru.

                        But RCB's top-order barring Parthiv Patel battted poorly again. Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Shimron Hetmyer were done in by leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal.

                        The SUV is the first product from the Citroen brand aimed at the Indian market and the company plans one new launch every year from 2021 after the flagship vehicle.
                        Paris-based PSA, known for its legacy Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands said in February it would launch the Citroen brand in India as it pursues a 50 percent group sales increase outside its home region by 2021.
                        To expand internationally, PSA is also relying on the Opel re-launch in Russia and the Peugeot comeback in the U.S. market.

                            <em>SAN FRANCISCO:</em>A trade group for the semiconductor industry on Wednesday called on U.S. government leaders to boost funding for chip research and science education while easing limits on green cards in an effort to counter China’s investments in chip technology.
                            The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents firms such as Intel Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Nvidia Corp, is asking U.S. officials to raise federal funding for chip research from a current $1.5 billion to $5 billion over the next five years and double funding for related fields such as materials science.
                            The group also wants changes to help it recruit skilled workers. In the short term, that means making it easier for skilled immigrants the industry needs from countries such as China and India to obtain permanent U.S. residency. And in the long term that means boosting education spending to double the number of American science and engineering graduates by 2029.

                Mumbai Indians (MI) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 37 runs at the Wankhede Stadium to register their 2nd win of the season. Chasing 171 runs, CSK were off to a poor start as they lost Ambati Rayudu for nought in the very 1st over. Again, in the 3rd over, Shane Watson went cheaply for 5.</p><p>The required run rate soared following the dismissal of the openers cheaply. Even Suresh Raina failed to score big and was dismissed by Jason Behrendorff for 16, caught at deep cover by Kieron Pollard, who took a stunner.</P><P>Captain MS Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav then stitched together a 54-run stand. Dhoni was dismissed for 12 off 21. Jadhav (58), who notched up his 4th IPL half-century, ran short of partners in the other end as CSK faltered in the chase to finish at 133/8 in 20 overs. This was the MS Dhoni-led outfit's first defeat in IPL 2019. Earlier, MI scored 170/5 in 20 overs courtesy a fine 59 off 43 balls by Suryakumar Yadav, 42 by Krunal Pandya and cameos from Man of the match Hardik Pandya (25 off 8) and Kieron Pollard (17 off 7). The duo scored 45 runs in last two overs. (SCORECARD)

The bowlers displayed a brilliant performance after Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard's quick-fire knock propelled Mumbai Indians to 170/5.
                        Chasing the target, Chennai started on a poor note, losing openers Ambati Rayudu and Shane Watson cheaply.</P><P>While Lasith Malinga accounted for Watson (5), Jason Behrendorff sent back Rayudu on a duck.
                        Chennai's most dependable batsman Suresh Raina also couldn't do much in the middle after managing just 16 runs off 15 deliveries.
